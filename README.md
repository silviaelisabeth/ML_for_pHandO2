# Machine Learning for pH and O2
Multilayered machine learning model for simultaneous detection of pH and dissolved O2 using optical chemical sensors.
The model comprises three layers of XGBoost regression algorithms. The first predicts the pH value, while the second and third layers predict the dissolved O2 concentration iteratively.
